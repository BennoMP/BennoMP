# So what is going on in this folder?

### Introduction to the sound card
In this folder, you can find images of the card in question, and possible solutions eventually.

### So what do I need help with?
Well, I want to use my Creative Sound Blaster Audigy (SB0090) in my Windows 10 computer but unfortunately drivers die when rebooting.
Although, they don't die straight away. For them dying and never working again, you need to log in, where a Creative registry updating application appears.
This application needs to die. Now I managed to do that but as soon as I changed one small thing in a control panel, the driver died and never produced sound again.

If there is someone who can assist me in finding a driver for this specific card, let me know on Twitter or something.
(Daniel_K's driver doesn't work, nor does manually installing the driver for a newer card)

### And why don't I build a period correct system?
Well it's too expensive for me and I don't have the permission to buy parts. I also think this would be a waste of money, since I won't be using that specific system much.
