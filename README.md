# Hello, I'm Benno

I'm 15 years old and live in the Netherlands. I do coding, I'm into (vintage) tech and like to compose music.
In the repository this readme is in you can find information about me and see pictures of things. Consider this repository a blog but in source code style.
Check out files and folders of non-coding related projects in here if you're interested!
